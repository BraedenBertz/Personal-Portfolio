        undergraduate research led by a faculty mentor. The research centers around the k-coupled tilings of the Aztec Diamond \
        where we are numerically exploring the height functions, their correlations, and distributions. It is a great\
        learning opportunity and has shown that while research can be hard, slow, and generally frustrating at times, \
        it can also be exciting and fun. Even though this research area is niche, the research skills I foster will \
        be a great addition to my skillset.',
